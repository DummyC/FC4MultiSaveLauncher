# FC4MultiSaveLauncher
A "launcher" for Far Cry 4 that automatically backup saves and lets you choose which save file to play before launching the game.

NOTE: This is designed as a standard save manager just like in Far Cry 3 so it overwrites the previous loaded backup save after you played on it.

NOTE #2: Backup your main saves (the ones that are in the game's save directory) and your backup saves (the ones that you backed up before) first for safekeeping in case this script turns into chaos.

Configure the scripts first to fit the directories you want the script to do stuffs on.
There are guides in the scripts written as comments.

Make a shortcut of launcher.main.bat to your desktop (rename it, change icon, etc.) and launch the game through that shortcut.
