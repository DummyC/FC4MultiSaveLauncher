# Far Cry 4 MultiSave Launcher
A "launcher" for Far Cry 4 that automatically backup saves and lets you choose which save file to play before launching the game.

NOTE #1: This is designed as a standard save manager just like in Far Cry 3 so it overwrites the previous loaded backup save after you played on it. The overwriting/backup occurs when you open up the launcher.main.bat again)

NOTE #2: Backup your main saves (the ones that are in the game's save directory) and your backup saves (the ones that you backed up before) first for safekeeping in case this script turns into chaos.


Guide:

1. Extract the zip anywhere but keep all the files inside a single folder.

2. Configure the scripts to fit the directories to your preferences. There are guides in the scripts written as comments.

3. Make a shortcut of launcher.main.bat to your desktop (rename it, change icon, etc.) and launch the game through that shortcut.



Feel free to criticize my work, after all this is my first and every improvement is welcome.
